   abstract = {Feature extraction is a crucial part of many MIR tasks. In this work, we present a system that can automatically ex-
tract relevant features from audio for a given task. The feature extraction system consists of a Deep Belief Network  (DBN) on Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFTs) of the audio. We then use the activations of the trained network as inputs for a non-linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. In particular, we learned the features to solve the task of genre recognition. The learned features perform significantly better than MFCCs. Moreover, we obtain a classification accuracy of 84.3\% on the Tzanetakis dataset, which compares favorably against state-of-the-art genre classifiers using frame-based features. We also applied these same features to the task of auto-tagging. The autotaggers trained with our features performed better than those that were trained with timbral and temporal features.}

How can machine learning---especially deep neural networks---make a real difference in your organization? This hands-on guide not only provides the most practical information available on the subject, but also helps you get started building efficient deep learning networks. The authors provide theory on deep learning before introducing their open-source Deeplearning4j (DL4J) library for developing production-class workflows. Through real-world examples, you will learn methods and strategies for training deep network architectures and running deep learning workflows on Spark and Hadoop with DL4J.},
