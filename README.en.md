## Project vision

This project is a part of my Master's thesis. The main goal is to build and compare two models for instrument recognition for polyphonic music. First is a traditional machine learning model, and the second one is a deep learning model.

## Milestones


1. Read audio files, plot some data.
2. Build some model with keras.
3. Collect better features.
4. Poliphonic inputs
